ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm [Your Name], a final year MBBS student with a knack for blending medicine with technology. I'm on a mission to develop projects and apps that could make a real difference in the medical world.

ðŸŒŸ My passion lies in finding ways to use tech to improve patient care and make life easier for healthcare professionals. Whether it's analyzing medical data or creating platforms for virtual consultations, I'm all in.

ðŸ’» When I'm not nose-deep in my medical books or coding, you'll probably find me brainstorming new ideas, joining hackathons, or lending a hand at local clinics. I'm super keen to collaborate and learn from others who share my interests in medicine and tech.

ðŸ”¬ Let's chat and see how we can work together to make a positive impact on healthcare! Drop me a message if you're up for collaborating, discussing ideas, or just want to chat about the latest breakthroughs in medicine and tech.
